Introduction
------------

Removes final keywords from source code on-the-fly and allows mocking of final methods and classes.
It can be used together with any test tool such as PHPUnit, Mockery or [Nette Tester](https://tester.nette.org).


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install is through Composer:

```
composer require dg/bypass-finals --dev
```

It requires PHP version 5.6 and supports PHP up to 7.4.


Usage
-----

Simply call this:

```php
DG\BypassFinals::enable();
```

You need to enable it before the classes you want to remove the final are loaded. So call it as soon as possible,
preferably right after `vendor/autoload.php` in loaded.
